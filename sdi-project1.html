<p>The theme that I chose for this first assignment was 'Dream Car'. I chose this as my 
	theme because it was the first personal situation that came to mind in which several 
	decision points became readily apparent. It is a highly abridged version of my close
	encounter with actually owning a Honda S2000.</p>
